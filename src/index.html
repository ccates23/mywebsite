  <p> I moved to Nashville in 1998 to pursue a career in the music industry. I landed in the touring side of the business and went on to tour with national acts for the next 17 years.</p>
  <p> I met my wife in 2006 and we married in 2010. Our son Mason was born in 2011 and I quickly realized that being on tour and being a dad were not something I wanted to mix.</p>
  <p> And so the search was on for a new career. One that not only had stability but, was also challenging and fullfilling. I've always been a good problem solver and had a passion for technology . Software developement met all those requirements.</p>
  <p> In April of 2015 I enrolled into the Nashville Software School. A six month bootcamp teaching front end and back end development with a back end focus on the Node.js platform. The program is intense and has been preparing me for my role in the Nashville technology community. I will be graduating in September and am excited to start my new career as a junior software developer.</p>
  <p> When I'm not working on a project I enjoy spending time with friends and my family. My wife and I live in Thompson's Station, TN and have two beautiful children. We love our community and enjoy experiencing all that Nashville has to offer.</p>
